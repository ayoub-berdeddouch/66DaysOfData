# 66DaysOfData
What is #66DaysOfData? The #66Days of Data is a initiative I started to help YOU develop better data science habits!   â€‹  The challenge is simple, all you have to do is:  Learn at least 5 minutes of data science every day for 66 days straight!  Share about what you learned each day on your favorite social platform!  (I like twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord)
