# 66DaysOfData

What is #66DaysOfData? 

The [#66Days of Data](https://www.kennethjee.com/66daysofdata) is a initiative I started to help YOU develop better data science habits!   

The challenge is simple, all you have to do is:  

    1. Learn at least 5 minutes of data science every day for 66 days straight!  
    2. Share about what you learned each day on your favorite social platform!  (I like twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord)

|According to James Clear, the average time it takes to engrain a new habit is 66 days. Since this challenge is focused on habits, I thought this time frame was appropriate! |#66DaysOfData has no start or end date. You can begin whenever you want. I will be doing it twice a year and you are welcome to join along with me! | You don't need anyone's permission, start learning and posting when you are ready! You can also join the discord (linked above) for some extra support and community!| Our goal is to establish great habits, not to learn all of data science in 66 days. 5 minutes is a low threshold that you should be able to stick to each day! |
